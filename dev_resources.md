Known for publishing great resources such as AFNetworking and PostgresApp, Mattt takes a weekly opportunity to dive into the less familiar corners of Objective-C and iOS through his blog NSHipster. 
* [Cocoa With Love](http://www.cocoawithlove.com/) - Matt Gallagherâ€™s blog that is filled with excellent design patterns that solve all types of common iOS programming problems.
