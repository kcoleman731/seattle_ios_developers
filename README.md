# Rhapsody iOS SDK

## Introduction

The Rhapsody iOS SDK was designed to provide a very easy way to integrate streaming music into your iOS application. The SDK itself handles playback and is used in conjunction with the [Rhapsody Developer API](http://developer.rhapsody.com) to give your users access to over 18 million tracks. The SDK plays full-length tracks for authenticated Rhapsody subscribers and 30-second samples for everyone else.

## Requirements

RhapsodyKit requires iOS 5.0 or later.

## Documentation

Documented header files can be found within the framework.
